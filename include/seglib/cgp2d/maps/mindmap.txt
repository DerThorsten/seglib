node_map_interface 
	merge(n0,n1)

edge_map_interface

why sep
  - merge
  - and another function "merge done"




/*
	maps which depend on each 
	other must reflect that
	in the order they are registered!


*/


the very new interface :
	/* for edges merge and constract means different things */ 
	mergeData( toMerge[],mergeIn)

	/* constract for edges might even update edge weights 
	   where the edge itself did not changed but one of the
	   regions
	*/
	contract(edgeIndex)
